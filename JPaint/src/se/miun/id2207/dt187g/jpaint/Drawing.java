/**
*Implements the Drawable interface.
*This class uses ArrayLists in order to add author, name of the drawing and the shapes used
*to make out the drawing. 
*It also calculates the total area and circumference for all the shapes as well as number of shapes
*the drawing consists out of. 
*
*Uses the .toString to each corresponding shape in order to give further detail about those shapes.
