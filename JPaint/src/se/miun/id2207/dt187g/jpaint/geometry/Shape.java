/**
* This is an abstract superclass used for various shapes like rectangles or circles.
*
*Subclasses needs to implement the specified abstrac methods. This in order to 
*calculate circumference, area, adding points and checking if there is a end point added.
*
* implements the Drawable interface.
*
* updated to adjust for an ArrayList
